# Implicit Services, i.e. spn's according Kerberos, 2nd edition
# from Mark PrÃ¶hl and Daniel Kobras, dpunkt publisher, page 326.
# Note: According this book, there shall be an LDAP-Object at
# CN=Directory Service,CN=Windows NT,CN=Services,CN=Configuration,dc=example,dc=com
# for domain example.com with attribute sPNMappings. In samba 4.17
# there is neither such an object nor the attribute somewhere in the tree
# und samba-tool spn lists computer$ does not list them either.
# Nevertheless samba-tool does export a keytab if that service is given,
# but samba-tool does not through an error when the service isn't available
# but instead does nothing.
